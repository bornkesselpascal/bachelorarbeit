@article{Anerousis.2021,
	abstract = {The term ``SDN'' represents a significant evolution in networking technology and draws attention and support from network operators, vendors, researchers and industry regulators. Contrary to popular belief that SDN is a recent invention, or is related only to IP technologies, the concept of network programmability and control/data plane separation has its roots in the 1960s and 1970s when the telephone network started its transition to digital. Many iterations followed, leading to applications in packet networks and today's Internet. In this article, we review a number of early works on network programmability that illustrate how several features of SDN emerged progressively over several decades. Our review starts from the early concepts of network control in the telephone network and continues to examine a prolific period of research advancements in the 1990s and early 2000s that led to a number of startup companies that followed, IEEE's own efforts in standardizing network programmability, and finally the arrival of the OpenFlow standard. We study the importance of this architectural transformation and its influences on modern cloud computing and next-generation networking.},

@article{Forney.1984,
	abstract = {This paper attempts to present a comprehensive tutorial survey of the development of efficient modulation techniques for bandlimited channels, such as telephone channels. After a history of advances in commercial high-speed modems and a discussion of theoretical limits, it reviews efforts to optimize two-dimensional signal constellations and presents further elaborations of uncoded modulation. Its principal emphasis, however, is on coded modulation techniques, in which there is an explosion of current interest, both for research and for practical application. Both block-coded and trellis-coded modulation are covered, in a common framework. A few new techniques are presented.},

@article{Macedo.2015,
	abstract = {Current implementations of Internet systems are very hard to be upgraded. The ossification of existing standards restricts the development of more advanced communication systems. New research initiatives, such as virtualization, software-defined radios, and software-defined networks, allow more flexibility for networks. However, until now, those initiatives have been developed individually. We advocate that the convergence of these overlying and complementary technologies can expand the amount of programmability on the network and support different innovative applications. Hence, this paper surveys the most recent research initiatives on programmable networks. We characterize programmable networks, where programmable devices execute specific code, and the network is separated into three planes: data, control, and management planes. We discuss the modern programmable network architectures, emphasizing their research issues, and, when possible, highlight their practical implementations. We survey the wireless and wired elements on the programmable data plane. Next, on the programmable control plane, we survey the divisor and controller elements. We conclude with final considerations, open issues and future challenges.},

@article{Xia.2015,
	abstract = {Emerging mega-trends (e.g., mobile, social, cloud, and big data) in information and communication technologies (ICT) are commanding new challenges to future Internet, for which ubiquitous accessibility, high bandwidth, and dynamic management are crucial. However, traditional approaches based on manual configuration of proprietary devices are cumbersome and error-prone, and they cannot fully utilize the capability of physical network infrastructure. Recently, software-defined networking (SDN) has been touted as one of the most promising solutions for future Internet. SDN is characterized by its two distinguished features, including decoupling the control plane from the data plane and providing programmability for network application development. As a result, SDN is positioned to provide more efficient configuration, better performance, and higher flexibility to accommodate innovative network designs. This paper surveys latest developments in this active research area of SDN. We first present a generally accepted definition for SDN with the aforementioned two characteristic features and potential benefits of SDN. We then dwell on its three-layer architecture, including an infrastructure layer, a control layer, and an application layer, and substantiate each layer with existing research efforts and its related research areas. We follow that with an overview of the de facto SDN implementation (i.e., OpenFlow). Finally, we conclude this survey paper with some suggested open research challenges.},
