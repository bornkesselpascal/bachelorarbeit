\chapter*{Abstract}
This bachelor thesis presents a detailed analysis of the reliability and performance of an Ethernet-based implementation for a Distributed Test Support System. A comprehensive test setup was established to closely resemble the conditions of a real Distributed Test Support System. Additionally, a specialized test program was developed to evaluate reliability and performance, with a focused examination of key indicators such as packet loss and latency.

The investigation covers an in-depth examination of various operating states in the system and highlights how these operating states affect performance and reliability. It also includes a detailed analysis of the impact of specific configuration settings on both computer systems and network interfaces and evaluates their role in terms of performance and reliability.

The research indicates that an Ethernet-based solution is appropriate for use in a Distributed Test Support System, with its limitations and performance constraints. These are discussed in the thesis, providing a comprehensive view of the capabilities of the setup and identifying potential areas for optimization.
